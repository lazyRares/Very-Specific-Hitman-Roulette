# Very-Specific-Hitman-Roulette
A randomizer for Hitman that's very specific. you can input your mastery and level and it will draw items from that as well.

Features
- Accounts for Mastery and Level 
- Saves your Mastery so you don't have to re-input each time
- Able to manually choose how many targets you want, can go up to 10.
- Generalized targets to allow players to choose whoever they'd like.

USE:

To use this randomizer you need to first install Visual Studio Code 2022, then launch and open the SLN for HitmanRoulette in Visual Studio. Then simply just run the program at the top and wait.

Now, you will be asked to either create a profile or not. Included with the Github release are two profiles: "Snail", and "The Mafia" which is mine and AgentSnail's mastery levels respectively. You can type "Y" or "N" to either create or use an existing profile.

If you choose to create a profile you will be asked what DLC's you own, and your mastery on each level. Once input, all the information is saved to the "HitmanRoulette/bin/txt/Profiles" folder.

Then the randomizer will ask you how many target's you'd like, this can be any number from 1 to 10.

Now it will randomize and give you that many target's, drawing kill conditions from the map it chose and also possible items you can bring with you at your current mastery. For example, if Mendoza was chosen, you might be asked to kill a Guard with the wine press, or with an Iceballer.

The system is not foolproof however, certain items like the Golden Shaska A33 or any other weapon that is unlockable at any time (Not restricted to mastery) may be chosen as a kill condition regardless if the player has them. There also may be scenarios where you need to either kill a unique NPC twice, or kill that NPC wearing their own unique disguise. This happens alot with Sapienza - The Author, where Craig Black may be requested to be killed twice. If this happens you can re-spin. Another scenario is being asked to kill an NPC in a way that requires them awake while wearing their disguise. You can get past this by allowing a guard to find the unconscius NPC, allowing them to wake-up, which then lets you fiber wire them or whatever was requested.
